#' The \pkg{missMS} package enables users to fit missing data models
#' models for label-free mass spectrometry experiments.  The package is
#' designed to make these models accesible to people without a background
#' in Bayesian statistics or missing data modeling.  This is done by
#' requiring users to follow a very specific format for data entry.  Once
#' the data is formatted properly everything else is handled internally.
